                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am a passionate and inquisitive developer and security specialist with a focus on web application security. With
                    4 years of experience, I have had the opprotunity to hone my skills with multiple incredible institutions such as 
                    Hack Reactor, the Technical College of the Rockies, and now York Solutions. My
                    dedication to not only security and development but also accessibility of technology sets me apart, and I thrive on
                    problem solving and gathering new information.</p>
